## Update 27/01

### Small Tasks:

- ~~run_period_fit must be updated to compare the two models and pick the best one (implement Bayesian Information Criterion)~~ 30/01
- ~~Store chain~~ 31/01
- Need to write functions to parse data from photometry
- ~~Update plots to incorporate errors (can extract from chains!)~~ 31/01
- Start thinking about applying the data analysis to Andromeda CV1

### Big Ones:

- ~~BIC is useful but also compare to literature & eyeball the fit; allow flexibility (reduced chi-squares)~~ 30/01
- ~~Once best model is picked, run emcee with desired model~~ 30/01
- Store chains (as dictionaries) and check whether they converged
- ~~Sample randomly from cepheid chains; period and magnitude (midline)~~ 31/01
- ~~Marginalised likelihood model for P-L relation (use literature values)~~ 31/01
- ~~Run emcee on P-L in a similar way to cepheid~~ 31/01
