## TODO for Photometry

- Increase apertures to 3*FWHM
- Evaluate sigma clipping effectiveness
- Add sigma-clipped background to centroiding
- Integrate and call airmass/dust extinction
- Input E(B-V) values for each cepheid
- Curve of growth and centroiding diagnostics
- Connect standard star photometry pipeline to extinction coefficients
- Error propagation (should be simple as errors already exist) needs to be integrated
- Only work in cutout images for photometry
- Check whether centroids actually converge
- Utilise reduction fixer to validate bad images
- Filter across standard stars
- Compute SNR and flag bad images (perhaps already done I cannot tell)
- Check whether NaN pixels exist still

Then check 2025-10-06.
