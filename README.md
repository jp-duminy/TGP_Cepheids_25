# Cepheids Telescope Group Project 2025/26

This is the repository for the University of Edinburgh cepheids TGP to measure the distance to the andromeda galaxy. This is a six-month endeavour for a team of five fourth-year students. Images of galactic classical cepheids were obtained from the PIRATE telescope in the Teide Observatory, Tenerife; images of the classical cepheid in Andromeda was provided by the Liverpool Telescope, Tenerife.
